# BESS Arbitrage Playground

A Python-based battery energy storage simulator that optimizes charging/discharging schedules for home battery systems using linear programming and day-ahead electricity pricing data. Maximizes arbitrage profits while accounting for battery wear and cycle costs.

## Features

- Linear programming optimization for battery scheduling
- Day-ahead pricing data from Dutch electricity market
- Battery wear modeling and cycle cost optimization
- Interactive visualizations with Altair
- Jupyter notebook for experimentation
